# StudentProfile-Project

🧩 Task: Student Profile & Type Casting
🎯 Goal
Create a simple Java program that:
uses
demonstrates
prints information to the console
Write a Java program called .

🔹 Step 1: Declare variables (Primitive types)

Inside the main method, declare the following variables:
int age → student age
double height → student height (in meters)
boolean isStudent → student status
Assign to these variables.

🔹 Step 2: Print student information

Print all variables to the console in this format:


Age: 12 
Height: 1.58 
Is student: true
🔹 Step 3: Implicit Type Casting (int → double)



Create an int variable called points and give it a value.



Create a double variable called pointsDouble.



Assign points to pointsDouble (without casting).



Print both values:


Points (int): 85 
Points (double): 85.0

🔹 Step 4: Explicit Type Casting (double → int)



Create a double variable called averageScore (for example: 89.7)



Cast it to an int variable called finalScore



Print both values:


Average score: 89.7 
Final score: 89
